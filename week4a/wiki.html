  <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href="https://example.com">markup language<sup>[a]</sup></a>
 for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="https://example.com">Web browser</a>
. It defines the content and structure of <a href="https://example.com">Wb content</a>

<p><a href="https://example.com">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href="https://example.com">images</a> and other objects such as <a href="https://example.com">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the rendered page.

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <a href="https://example.com">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a href="https://example.com">Browsers</a> do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p>HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="https://example.com">scripting language</a> such as <a href="https://example.com">Javascript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.

   <p><h4>Development</h4>

<p>
IIn 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee
wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data
systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request
for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many
areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first
entry.[5]</p><p>
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document
called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet
by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements
comprising the initial, relatively simple design
of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
still exist in HTML 4.[9]</p>

<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
compose text, images, and other material into visible
or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of
HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional
use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO
technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the
features of early text formatting languages such as that
used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early
1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system.
These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters
to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized
markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes)
rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
</p><p>
Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was
formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal
for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an
SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11] The
draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment
of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards
on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet
Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[12]
</p><p>
After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF
created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group
completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to
be treated as a standard against which future implementations
should be based.[13]
</p><p>
Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by
competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications
have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors,
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML
became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001.
In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on
28 October 2014.[15]
